    <h1>Tapu Lele Raids</h1>  
    <div>
        <p>
            Tapu Lele is a Tier 5 legendary raid boss in Pokémon Go and marks 
            its debut in the 
            <a href="https://pokemongohub.net/post/event/lush-jungle-event-2022/">
                Lush Jungle Event 2022, 
            </a>
            running from March 22nd, 10 AM – March 29th, 8 PM, 2022.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tapu Lele is currently a case of lost potential 
            as it doesn’t learn Charm in 
            <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/it/">
                Pokémon Go 
            </a>
            (which it can learn in the Main Series Games). 
            Even from the Psychic POV, its moves aren’t the best. 
            So while Tapu Lele doesn’t dazzle in either of its typing, 
            it can experience a change of fortunes with something like 
            Charm being added to its moveset in the future. Anyway, 
            it is still a legendary Dex addition, to say the least.
