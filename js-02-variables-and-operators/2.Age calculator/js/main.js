/*  2.Age calculator
● Store your birth year in a variable.
● Store a future year in a variable.
● Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.
● For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or
38, depending on what month it is in 2026.
● Output them to the screen like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY",
substituting the values.
