# 3.Palindrome

### Text Exercises:
Using your reverse() function from the previous exercise, write a simple
function to check if a string is a palindrome.
● A palindrome is a word that reads the same backwards as forwards. For
example, the word "madam" is a palindrome.
● Write a JavaScript function called isPalindrome which has one parameter, a
string, and which returns true if that string is a palindrome, else false.
● For example, the call isPalindrome("madam") should return true, while
isPalindrome("madame") should return false.
● Bonus: Try to write the same function without using the reverse() function

# Exercise Executed
I created a function using the reverse of the string as a comparison using the function from the previous exercise
