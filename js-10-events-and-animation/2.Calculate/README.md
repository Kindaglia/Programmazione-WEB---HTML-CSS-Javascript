# 2.Calculate

### Text Exercises:

Start with the following HTML:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Calculator</title>
</head>
<body>
    <label>Square this number:
        <input type="number" id="square-input" size="2">
    </label>
    <button id="square-button">Calculate</button>
    <!--other inputs here -->
    <div id="solution"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

● Add inputs for half number, percentage and circle area  
● Use the functions from the previous calculator exercises  
● For each operation, create an event listener for the button, and when it's
clicked, find the value of the appropriate input and show the result of the
calculation in the solution div
● Afterwards, change the code so that you respond to key presses so that the user doesn't have to click the button

# Exercise Executed

I created funtions and call them with the buttons on html.
