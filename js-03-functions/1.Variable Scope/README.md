### Text Exercises:
1. Recreate the local and global scope examples in your browser
2. Try to call the function “addNumbers” a few more times
3. Write a new .js file that uses both local and global variables in the same
project
4. Make sure that you understand exactly what’s happening at every stage



## Exercises:
Testing both pieces of code I noticed that in the local one, it performs only once and then gives an error, while in the global one the function can be called several times and does not give an error.
